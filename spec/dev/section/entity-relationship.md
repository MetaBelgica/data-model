## Entity-Relationship model

Generally we distinguish the following three types of [=entities=].

1. Persons
2. Organizations (Corporate bodies)
3. Locations

Persons will be linked to locations to indicate the birth and death place of a person.
Similarly, organizations will be linked to locations to indicate where an organiation is established.

Each of these entities has a number of properties such as related dates, but most importantly external identifiers to other reliable databases.
