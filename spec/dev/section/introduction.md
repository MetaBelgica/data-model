## Introduction

The goal of MetaBelgica is to provide high quality reference data for Belgian Cultural Heritage. Data is collaboratively maintained by initially four Federal Scientific Institutes (FSIs) in a Wikibase instance. 
This also sets the scope: reference data about [=authorities=] linked to Federal Collections.
For semantic interoperability we will use the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to define a common data model.
Additionally we provide a Wikibase data model as well as a mapping between the RDF data model and the Wikibase data model.

This document specifies overall considerations about the data model.
Detailed documentation about the RDF vocabulary is available via the tool Widoco.
