The goal of MetaBelgica is to collaboratively maintain authority data related to Belgian Cultural Heritage from initially four Federal Scientific Institutes (FSIs) in a Wikibase instance.
For semantic interoperability we will use the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to define a common data model.
Additionally we provide a Wikibase data model as well as a mapping between the RDF data model and the Wikibase data model.

This document specifies overall considerations about the data model.
Detailed documentation about the RDF vocabulary is available via the tool Widoco.
