## Introduction

The goal of MetaBelgica is to provide high quality reference data for Belgian Cultural Heritage. Data is collaboratively maintained by initially four Federal Scientific Institutes (FSIs) in a Wikibase instance. 
This also sets the scope: reference data about [=authorities=] linked to Federal Collections.
For semantic interoperability we will use the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to define a common data model.
Additionally we provide a Wikibase data model as well as a mapping between the RDF data model and the Wikibase data model.

This document specifies overall considerations about the data model.
Detailed documentation about the RDF vocabulary is available via the tool Widoco.

### Document conventions

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions and [[RFC2119]] terminology. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.
